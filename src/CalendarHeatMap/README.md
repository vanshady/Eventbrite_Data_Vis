Through this data visualization, we see the distribution of events date-wise for the year 2015. Eventbrite's data is accessible through their JSON API. This visualization makes use of the same API to query and get the data related to the start dates of the events. 

### Features
This section enlists the features of the Calendar heatmap data visualization. 
* Displays the data for the entire year 2015 (the year for which the data was queried)
* Makes use of UNIX epoch time for keeping track of the dates of the year. The data available from Eventbrite API is in "YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS" format. This is converted into UNIX epoch time using the time.mk_time function available in Python.
* On hovering the mouse over each date, it displays the date value and the number of events that have occured/ will occur on that particular day.
* The darker the color of the day, more the number of events that were held on that day and vice versa.

### Files
This section provides a brief description of the all the files and their purpose in this directory. 
* `CalendarHeatmap.html`: HTML5 code for rendering the Javascript heatmap in the browser
* `GetDateValues.py`: Python script for extracting the values of the start date of the events of Eventbrite (See file header  comments for detailed description and elaborate comments)
* `data.csv`: Text information that is obtained from the `GetData.py` python script. When I engineered this project, I ran the `GetData.py` script only once to fetch all the data that I wanted to analyze and present visually. 
* `README.md`: This file
* `cal-heatmap.css`: CSS for displaying the Calendar Heatmap, obtained from [cal-heatmap](http://kamisama.github.io/cal-heatmap/)
* `cal-heatmap.min.js`: Javascript and Jquery file for displaying the Calendar Heatmap, obtained from [cal-heatmap](http://kamisama.github.io/cal-heatmap/)
* `dateTimeJSON.json`: JSON file that is generated by `GetDateValues.py` and that acts as the input to the HTML rendering. This file contains all the data points that we need to plot on the Calendar Heatmap. The values in the JSON string are in UNIX epoch time format, along with the number of events that are held on that day.
