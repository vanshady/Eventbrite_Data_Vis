Through this data visualization, we see the distribution of different formats of events that occur on Eventbrite. Eventbrite's data is accessible through their JSON API. This visualization makes use of the same API to query and get the data related to the format. 

### Features

* Displays a bubble in the Bubble chart for each type/ format of event on Eventbrite.
* Upon hovering the mouse over each format, a detailed view of the format, along with the number of events occuring/ occured in the state is displayed as a tooltip (See screenshots below).
* The larger the size of the format, more the number of events that were held with that particular format and vice versa.
